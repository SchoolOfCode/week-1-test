            - When the button is pressed, the text in the h1 tag should change to reflect what the user has entered in the input field.
            - If the input field is empty, this change shouldn't happen
            - Use the onclick attribute to achieve this
            - Bonus points for a warning message (however you like) for an empty input field attempt
